## Merge Sort:
Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It divides the input array into smaller subarrays, sorts them individually, and then merges them back together to obtain the sorted array. Let's step through the Merge Sort algorithm using the provided pseudocode and visualize the output at each iteration.

## Visual Step-through:


**Efficiency**

- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`

- Space Complexity: `O(n)`
